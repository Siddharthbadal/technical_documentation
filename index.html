			<p>A software, in its most general sense, is a set of instructions and programms instructing a computer to do a sepcific task. Scripts, applications, programs are also used to describe software. A software program is a set of instruction or procedures, that are required to perform sectain type of operation.</p> <br>
			<p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        <span><strong>Software development </strong></span> is a magical art of creating a program which can perform a required task following a set of processes. Software development includes mainly three steps thinking, designing, and implementation.
			With software development, we must also know about <span> <strong>Software development life cycle </strong></span>(SDLC). SDLC is a detailed plan explaining all major steps of a software development. There are mainly six steps in SDLC:</p> 
			
			<ul> 
				<li> Planning</li>
				<li>Analysis</li>
				<li>Design</li>
				<li>Implementation</li>
				<li>Testing & Integration</li>
				<li>Maintenance</li>
			</ul> <br>
			<h3>Basic termnology for sotware development</h3>
			<p>Here are few terms used in web development</p>
			<p><strong>Bugs</strong>: A bug is a program error.</p>
			<p><strong>Compiler</strong>: A program that translates a high level language program into an independent machine code program.</p>
			<p><strong>API</strong>: “Application Program Interface. How computers and applications communicate with one another.</p>
			<p><strong>Debugging</strong>: The process of locating and fixing or bypassing bugs(errors)</p>
			<p><strong>Attribute</strong>: Information about elements of a component in your website design/build.</p>
			<p><strong>Navigation</strong>: Links on a homepage that break down the other pages of a website. This can be both in the menu at the top of a site or in a footer (preferably both).</p>
			<p><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: Websites that accommodate the screen on which they’re being viewed.</p>
			<p><strong>Meta Tag</strong>: Additional information on web pages or elements, such as the way a piece of content should display in Google search results, the photo credit for an image, or the main keywords associated with a plugin.</p> 
			<p><strong>Framework</strong>: Suite of programs used in website or software development.</p>
			<p><strong>Domain</strong>: The address for a website as entered into the browser.
			(www.freecodecamp.com!).
			<p><strong>404</strong>: Error message when what was requested cannot be found; often because the link that was requested is either broken or dead. </p>

				 <br></p>
			<p>	JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.<br>
				<p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects</p><br>
				<code>
		<xmp>
		function firstCode(funName)
		{
		  console.log(funName)
		}
		  firstCode("JavaScript")
		</xmp>
				 
				</code> <br>
			<p>
			Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
			</p>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
			</p> <br>

			<h3>Variables</h3>
			<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. <br>
			A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p> <br>

		<code> 
			<xmp>	
			var x = 50;
			let y = 50;
			</xmp>
		</code>

			<h3>Constants</h3>
			<p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. <br>
			A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>

			<code> 
			<xmp>	
						
			const fcc= 3.3;
			</xmp>
			</code> <br>
			<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.</p> <br>

			<h3>Data Type </h3>
			<h5>There are six types of data types in java script</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Boolean, true and false</li>
				<li>null, A special keyword denoting a null value </li>
				<li>undefined</li>
				<li>Number</li>
				<li>String</li>
				<li>Symbol</li>
				<li>And Object</li>
			</ul> <br>

		<h3>What you should already know before learning JavaScript</h3>
			<ul>
					<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) & CSS</li>
					<li>Basic programming skills</li>
				</ul> <br>

			<p>	HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. </p> <p>HyperText simply means "Text within Text</p>
			<p>
			<strong>Markup languages</strong> are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of the text. it is like a blueprint or layout for the processing and appearance of text documents. <br>
			<span><strong> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; HTML is not a programming language.</strong></span> HTML is  the standard markup language for web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and represented by < > tags. HTML is consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. </p> <br>
			<code>
				<xmp>
		<p> Understandinf HTML</p>

		<p> is a opening tag AND 
		</p> is a closing tag.
				</xmp>
			</code>
			<p>
				<h3>Description of HTML </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Doctype, Defines the document type</li>
					<li>Html tag, This tag informs the browser that it is a HTML document </li>
					<li>Head tag, First element inside the HTML</li>
					<li>Title tag, used to add the title</li>
					<li>Body tag, body the the page. content comes here.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<code>
				<xmp>
		<p class="understanding_HTML"> 
		Understanding HTML</p>

		Here, class="understanding-HTML"
		is Attributes.
				</xmp>
			</code>
				Attributes contain extra information about the element that doesn't appear on the acual content. Above, <strong>class</strong> is the attribute name and understadinh-HTMLis tbute value. Class gives an identifier that can be used later to target the element with the style information. </p> <br>
				<p>We can use image in HTML with img tag</p>
				<code>
				<xmp>
		<img src="">

		src is source or path for the image.

				</xmp>

		<section class="main-section" id="understanding_css">
			<header>Understanding CSS</header>
			<p> <strong>CSS</strong> stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading <strong>S</strong>tyle <strong>S</strong>heets. </p>
			<p> CSS desribes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the web page. CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users how they are styled or laid out. 
			</p>
			<p>A <strong>Document</strong> is usally a text file structure using markup languages (HTML) and 
			<strong>Presenting</strong> a documnet to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience</p>

			<code>
				<xmp>
		p
		  {
			 color: blue;
			 font-size; 20px
		   }

		*p is for paragraph tag in HTML.
		color is blue, that to be 
		applied on paragraph 
		with font-size of 20 pixels.

				</xmp>
			</code>
			 <h3>Why use CSS</h3>
				<p>Three main advantages of using CSS:
			<ul>
					<li>Saves time: By using it multiple times for different web pages. and even inside a web page we do not have to create different style for different elements seperately.</li>	
					<li>Faster loading: It allows us to writeminimal code for HTML. Less code means less loading time. </li>
					<li>Superior styles to HTML: CSS offers much wider array of attributes than HTML, so can give a better look to web page in comparison to HTML attributes. </li>
					<li>Multiple Device Compatibility: Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented.</li>
			</ul> <br>
			
				<h3>How does CSS work</h3> 
				<p>A document combines the content with its style information to get displayed in a browser. This works on different level.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The browser loads the HTML</li>
				<li>converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model).</li>
				<li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linkeRead more on mages and videos</li>
				<li>The browser parses the fetched CSS.</li>
